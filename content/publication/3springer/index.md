abstract: Aberrant accumulation of protein misfolding can cause aggregation and fibrillation and is one of the primary characteristic features of neurodegenerative diseases. Because they are disordered, misfolded, and aggregated proteins pose a significant setback in drug designing. The structural study of intermediate steps in these kinds of aggregated proteins will allow us to determine the conformational changes as well as the probable pathways encompassing various neurodegenerative disorders. The analysis of protein aggregates involved in neurodegenerative diseases relies on a diverse toolkit of biophysical techniques, encompassing both morphological and non-morphological methods. Additionally, Thioflavin T (ThT) assays and Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy facilitate investigations into aggregation kinetics and secondary structure alterations. The collective application of these biophysical techniques empowers researchers to comprehensively unravel the intricate nature of protein aggregates associated with neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the topics covered in this review have summed up a handful of well-established techniques used for the structural analysis of protein aggregation. This multifaceted approach advances our fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving neurodegenerative diseases and informs potential therapeutic strategies.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Aggregates have a variety of sizes and other physicochemical characteristics, making them diverse. As a direct consequence of this, a single technique is not merely sufficient to adequately analyze all the properties of aggregate particles. The findings acquired with one approach are inextricably related to those procured with another since every technique measures a different prospect of the enormous characteristic of aggregates. Development in protein aggregation research is driven by numerous approaches, including the structural study of protein aggregation. Besides, using numerous biophysical studies, the structural properties of amyloid at the insoluble and solvable processes have been reviewed, however, further research on the intermediate stage of the aggregated proteins is still under consideration. Herein, a short description of protein aggregation's structural analysis strategies using various biophysical techniques has been discussed. Using Fluorescence spectroscopy, FTIR, NMR, and CD, structural modifications during protein aggregation can be understood which will help in developing therapeutics for many diseases induced by protein aggregation. Thus, along with other multidisciplinary methods, the insights obtained using these strategies will advance our level of awareness of protein aggregation and misfolding and related therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases as well.
