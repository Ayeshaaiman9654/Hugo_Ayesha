title: Characterization of recombinant IFN β-1b and elucidation of its role as a therapy/regimen against Multiple Sclerosis
summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a metabolically dependent neurodegenerative disorder caused by persistent axonal loss of the brain and spinal cord. It is the most prevalent cause of non-traumatic neurological disability among young adults, especially females, in Western countries. DMTs and cost-effective pharmacotherapies can help patients address their condition by lowering their risk of relapse, postponing disability, and/or having fewer Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion loads. Interferon is one of the first-line therapies to treat MS patients in India. This project addresses the desire for developing novel therapeutic regimens and their essential role in improving patients’ health.
