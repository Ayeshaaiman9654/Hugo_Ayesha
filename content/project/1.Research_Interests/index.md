title: Research Interest
summary: I am interested in the field of protein folding and dynamics. My primary area of research interest focuses on the comprehensive analysis of the interferon signature, as well as the numerous test methodologies for the synthesis of modified interferon analogues so that we can design and develop a therapy for a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Multiple sclerosis.

<!-- 
 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a metabolically dependent neurodegenerative disorder caused by persistent axonal loss of the brain and spinal cord. It is the most prevalent cause of non-traumatic neurological disability among young adults, especially females, in Western countries. DMTs and cost-effective pharmacotherapies can help patients address their condition by lowering their risk of relapse, postponing disability, and/or having fewer Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion loads. Interferon is one of the first-line therapies to treat MS patients in India. This project addresses the desire for developing novel therapeutic regimens and their essential role in improving patients’ health. -->
